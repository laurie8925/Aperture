## Overview

This is a wellness daily entry app to reflect on your day! Each day, the app will give you a reflective prompt about your day and you have to submit a photo as an answer to the daily prompt.

### Problem Space

This application is not a necessity for most people, but it can help users improve their perspective on life. Many of us are so focused on getting things done in our lives, constantly stressed, that we end up feeling burned out. This app allows users to spend less than 5 minutes a day actively reflecting on the positive aspects of their day. It serves as a tool to help users build a good habit of thinking positively about their lives, even in small ways. Over time, it encourages us to appreciate the little things and realize that life isnâ€™t as bad as we might thought it to be.
